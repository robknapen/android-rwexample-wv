====================

Roundware V2.0 example Android app with webviews, using RWFramework.

This is a working example Android app that uses the RWFramework to access the Roundware server.
It is based on the Roundware 2.0 protocol and has a simple Speak and Listen screen that illustrates
the use of the core Roundware functionality.

Essentially it is an adapted version of the RWExample app, but now using web views for the Speak and Listen screens.
